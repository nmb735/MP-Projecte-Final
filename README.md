## 🧩 Context and Introduction

- Final project for the *Metodologia de la Programació* (MP) course at Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona (UAB). This subject is part of the first year of the Computer Science Enginnering BSc.

- In this project, we had the goal of developing a full-stack chess game using C++.

- Our main objective was to apply the fundamental programming methodologies we learned throughout the course to create a functional and playable chess game.

- Despite being first-year students with minimal experience in best practices for programming and Git, we managed to successfully implement a working version of the chess game. While we have a playable chess game, please note that there are some advanced features and rules we did not fully implement.

## ✨ Features

Here's what our chess game offers:

- **Classic Chess Gameplay:** Play a traditional game of chess with a functioning board and pieces.
- **Two-Player Mode:** Multiplayer mode.
- **Move Validation:** Basic move validation to ensure legal moves.

## 🚧 Known Limitations

While we have a fully operational chess game, there are some advanced chess rules and features that we did not implement:

1. **Castling:** The special move where the king and rook move simultaneously.
2. ***En Passant:*** A special pawn capture move.
3. **Promotion:** When a pawn reaches the opponent’s end, it should be able to be promoted to any piece of the player’s choice.

We focused on the core functionalities of the game but didn't cover these more complex rules due to time constraints and our level of expertise.
